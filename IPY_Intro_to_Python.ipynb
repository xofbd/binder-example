    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an open-source, high-level, dynamically-typed general-purpose scripting language.  Its philosophy emphasizes code readability and flexibility, but with one preferred, \"Pythonic\", way to do things. Data science has gravitated towards Python as an implementation language due to its flexibility and large, open-source community. Consider the following motivating reasons to learn Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compared to Java and C, Python is relatively easy to use and learn. The following program written in Java prints a message.\n",
    "```Java\n",
    "public class HelloWorld {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In Python, it's simply:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Python is a general purpose programming language, unlike R. While we will focus on Python for data science, you can use your Python skills for things such as [web development](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) thanks to Python's many third-party packages.\n",
    "* Python is open-source and free, unlike MATLAB and SAS. There is no need for expensive licensing and open-source nature leads to a larger community of developers.\n",
    "* There is a large collection of mature numerical libraries, primarily [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/). These packages are the basis of important data science tools such as [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/). "
